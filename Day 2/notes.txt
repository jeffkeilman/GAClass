JavaScript -
Five primitives of JS:
1. Number
  1. -0
  2. NaN
  3. Infinity ALL NUMBERS ACCORDING TO JS
2. String
  1. ''
  2. "Not empty"
3. Boolean
  1. true
  2. false
4. null
5. undefined

4, 5 are different! Null: explicitly *nothing*. Absolutely should not have a value.
Undefined often doesn't have a value *yet*.

Literals: represent specific values in the source code. For instance, 1, 'A string',
null. All of these values are very specific, there will never be another '1'.

Variables: A value stored in memory that can change.

We will use Node as a ***REPL***
1. Read
2. Evaluate
3. Print
4. Loop

Think of this as a sandbox. A great place to play around. Go to terminal, enter
'node' to enter.

Will always use strict equal and strict does not equal in class. === !==

Truthy and Falsy:
Everything in JS is inherently truthy except:
1. false
2. undefined
3. null
4. 0 and -0
5. NaN
6. '', "", and ``

Any time you clone a new repo, go ahead and run npm install to pull in all
dependencies.

bin is short for binary, lib short for library. bin will typically be run in
terminal.

process.argv[] < An array that stores all args passed when running a script

grunt nag: run linter

string interpolation:
console.log(`Sorry, your guess '${answer}', isn't correct.`);
